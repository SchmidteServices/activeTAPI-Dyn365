## Microsoft Dynamics Business Central (BC)

Dynamics 365 applications based on a different technology, like **Dynamics 365 BC**, have not yet been tested, and they are not yet supported.

## Microsoft Dynamics CRM On-Premise 2016 and older

Initially, activeTAPI was integrated with **Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011**. activeTAPI is based on the [MSPro Dynamics Platform Services Technology](~/_content/serviceplatform/README.md) which makes it very independent of the Dynamics version. However, client-side scripting for a\) Platform communication and b\) for displaying messages on the form had to be adjusted. We do not yet support this out-of-the-box, but if you are interested in doing this, [let us know](mailto:msc@activeTAPI.net).
