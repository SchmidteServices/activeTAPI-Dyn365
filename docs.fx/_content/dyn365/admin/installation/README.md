# Installation

Out-of-the-box, telephone numbers will be formatted and validated only on the Contact Main Form. Other entities and forms can be configured when required (see [Extend Integration](./extend-integration.md)).

> [!NOTE]
> We made the decision, the provide an **out-of-the-box integration with the Contact Main Form only**,   
> because we wanted to change as little as possible in your existing environment, leaving it up to you, to 'complete' the setup, based on your business' requirements.
