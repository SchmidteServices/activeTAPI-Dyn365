# Add or change a license

**ClientID = License Key**

If you don't have a dedicated license, activeTAPI uses the so called [shared license](http://activetapi.net/licensing/sharedlicense/?target=_blank). If you decided to purchase your dedicated license you have got a license key from your vendor which looks like this:

`sA/4sFh50KE0BY2NS1JVMLv4LZ5uH1Ui1WE4Kf8KCt...5g=` 

[Navigate to activeTAPI Settings Entity](settingentity.md) and add or edit the follwing settings: 

```
Key = ActiveTAPI.ClientId
Value = <licenseKey>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Please notice, the key is case-sensitve!

Set its value to the license key you have received.
