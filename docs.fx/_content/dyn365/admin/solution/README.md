# Solution Package

Thanks to [MSPro Dynamics Platform Services](~/_content/serviceplatform/introduction.md) activeTAPI does not change or modify any functionality in your organization. The solution, and also the functionality, are completely separated from all existing items and functionality!

The only connection point that is required to use _activeTAPI_ in your organization is a reference on those forms where you want to use telephone number formatting and validation.

By default, activeTAPI is activated on the Contact Main Form, only.
