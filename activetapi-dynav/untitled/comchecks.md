# ComChecks

ComChecks is a small application which checks the correct installation of activeTAPI. It checks, all required COM-Objects are registered and all .NET Components are installed and reachable.

If, for example, Registry entries are missing, COM-Objects cannot be instantiated properly. If a .NET component cannot be found in its expected location \(e.g. GAC\), such object creation will fail as well.

ComChecks checks all the required settings

\(see also [NAV-Clients](NavClients.md)\)

## Installation

Download `ComChecks.v2013` from here and unzip it to any directory.

Execute the appropriate ComCheck application \(x86 or x64\), depending on the NAV-Client you have planned to use.

## How to use

To execute ComCheck just run `ComCheck.v2013.exe` from a Console window \(cmd.exe\). If everything is ok, you will see a result like this:

All results will be logged to

`%AppData%\Roaming\Schmidt e-Services GmbH\activeTAPI.COM\Logs`

In case of any failure, please uninstall and re-install activeTAPI, before you may send the log files to [msc@schmidt-e-services.de](mailto:msc@schmidt-e-services.de) for diagnosis.
