# Introduction

Welcome to _activeTAPI for Microsoft Dynamics 365_ technical and background information.

So far, we have tested activeTAPI with Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM On-Premise. A package for Microsoft Dynamics 365 CE is available on Microsoft-AppSource.

## Older Microsoft Dynamics CRM Versions

Initially, activeTAPI was integrated with **Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011**. activeTAPI is based on the [_MSPro Dynamics Platform Services_](serviceplatform/introduction.md) Technology which makes it very independent of the Dynamics version. However, client-side scripting for a\) Platform communication and b\) for displaying messages on the form had to be adjusted. We do not yet have this out-of-the-box, but if you are interested in some kind of "joint venture" to adapt activeTAPI, [let us know](mailto:msc@activeTAPI.net).
