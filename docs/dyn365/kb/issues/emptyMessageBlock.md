activeTAPI is based on the **[MSPro Dynamics Power Platform](..\servicePlatform\index.md)**. If Dynamics *Plug-in Trace Log* does not contain a message block, your Dynamics 365 environment did not start the Plug-in, and the *MSPro Dynamics Power Platform* did not start to execute: *Pre Execution Error*.
