# Knowledge Base

In the section we collect solutions for all known issues, you might face when using activeTAPI.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 together with Power Apps and Microsoft Common Data Service are very complex platforms. We are testing as good as possible, to make sure, activeTAPI works in any case. However, depending on your environment and its configuration you might see the one or the other issue.

Please, check if you find the solution here, otherwise [send us an e-mail](mailto:support@activeTAPI.net) so that we can work together on the solution.

{% hint style="info" %}
activeTAPI becomes active after you have left the current field. Normally, it takes a second or two to format the telephone number. However, initially it can also take a bit longer.

If activeTAPI does not format the number or show any result at all, continue here to see [how to find the root cause](https://github.com/SchmidteServices/activeTAPI-Dyn365/tree/fdf35674578228b1890aaaa8991a83ec3a26c4e5/docs/dyn365/kb/digDown.md).
