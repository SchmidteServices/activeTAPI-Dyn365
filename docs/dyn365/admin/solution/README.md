# Solution Package

Thanks to [_MSPro Dynamics Platform Services_](../../../serviceplatform/introduction.md) activeTAPI does not change or modify any functionality in your existing organization. The solution, and also the functionality, are completely separated from all existing items and functionality!

The only connection point that is required to use _activeTAPI_ in your organization is a reference on those forms where you want to use telephone number formatting and validation.

 By default, activeTAPI is activated on the  Contact Main Form, only.
