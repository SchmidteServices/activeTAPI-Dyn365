Well, activeTAPI does not actually format the telephone number. That is the reason why you're reading these pages, isn't it? But now, you have got some more information! Navigate to the Plug-In Trace Log entity (see above). Refresh your view and, you should see some records: If there is a Exception it is very important to get the complete exception information. Select, copy and past and open with any editor. Maybe you can immediately see what is wrong, otherwise check the Knowledge Base for the exception message, or send us an e-mail.

JavaScript mspro_/js/activeTapi.js Contains the activityTAPI functionality which will be active on the form where this script is beeing used (see Extend Integration ). OnForm.Load() activeTAPI.js registers OnChanged handlers, for all Phone attributes, as follows: onLoad: function (executionContext) { ... // ZERO CONFIG: // * get all attributes with format = 'phone' // * Add 'fax' - which is not a 'phone' field :-( // and register activeTAPI handle for these fields. // formContext.data.entity.attributes.get().forEach(function (a) { if (a.getFormat() == 'phone' || a.getName() == 'fax') { // ... register on attribute changed ... register onAttributeChanged() handler } } } onAttributeChanged() // _formatTelephoneNumber { mspro.platformServices.sendMessage(\"ActiveTapi.FormatNumbers\", ... } mspro_/js/platformServices.js This script belongs to MSPRo Dynamics Platform Services .

Its functionality is to execute the business logic that was requested by the client (see JavaScript SendMessage ). In case of activeTAPI, the sandboxed Plug-in executes the REST calls to the activeTAPI-REST Service . Note This means, all activeTAPI logic is server-side and executes in the context of this Plugin. The Plug-in is registered on the mspro_servicemessage entity as follows: [!NOTE] It is important to notice that this Plug-in is registered on the mspro_servicemessage entity, only, which is part of the activeTAPI Solution.
