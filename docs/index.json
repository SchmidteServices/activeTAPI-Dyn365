Let's simulate a typo and enter 0141 556677 instead of the correct 0151 556677 - which is a mobile number. Country: guessed : The entered number did not contain a country code. That's why activeTAPI is 'guessing' a configurable default country code. In this case +49 for Germany. Area: uncertain : activeTAPI could not find any match for the given area, in the guessed country. activeTAPI won't claim, the area is definitely invalid because area codes change frequently. Let's fix the area code to 151 and see what happens: Obviously activeTAPI has adjusted the area code, and it seems even area code 151 is only half the truth: 15112 is the full area code: Country codes Let's play with country codes: +1 is the country code for the United States of America (and other countries). activeTAPI recognizes a leading '00' or a '+' as: the number starts with a country code . activeTAPI recognized the country is ok, however for this country somethings is wrong with the area code: Fix area code to: and activeTAPI takes care of the rest.

Note Solutions are how customizers and developers author, package, and maintain units of software that extend Common Data Service. For example, Dynamics 365 for Sales, Marketing, Customer Service apps are composed of solutions. Customizers and developers distribute solutions so that organizations can use Common Data Service to install and uninstall the business functionality defined by the solution. ( ref. Microsoft Power Apps ) The functionality is simple and powerful. It validates and formats telephone numbers while you're entering them. Behind the scenes, all activeTAPI validation and formatting logic comes from the activeTAPI-REST Service . The Solution itself contains only the components required to integrate this service with the Dynamics platform. Out-of-the-box activeTAPI becomes active on your Dynamics 365 Contact Main Form , only. However, you can configure activeTAPI to format telephone numbers wherever you want - more... . activeTAPI-Dyn365 In short, the product is called activeTAPI-Dyn365 .
