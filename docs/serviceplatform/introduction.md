# MSPro Dynamics 365 - Platform Services

**MSPro** is me: Markus Schmidt - [http://markuschmidt.pro](http://markuschmidt.pro)

**Dynamics Platform Services** is my invention, created in 2011, when struggling with the 'nature' of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 and the inability to implement custom business logic.

In 2019, I have refreshed this invention and I have used it for activeTAPI. I updated it to the latest SDK and verified its compatibility with the latest Microsoft Dynamics 365 products and with Microsoft Common Data Service.

Well, surprisingly, after my five years of 'CRM absence', I recognized, such technology still does not exist out of the box. And with **Microsoft Common Data Service** and **Power Apps**, I think, it is required more than ever.

### What is MSPro Dynamics Platform Services

stay patient ... need some time ...
