So far, we have tested activeTAPI with Microsoft Dynamics 365 - CRM On-Premise. A package for Microsoft Dynamics 365 CE is available on Microsoft-AppSource.

## Older Microsoft Dynamics CRM Versions

Initially, activeTAPI was integrated with **Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011**. activeTAPI is based on the [*MSPro Dynamics Platform Services*](servicePlatform/index.md) Technology which makes it very independent of the Dynamics version. However, client-side scripting for a) Platform communication and b) for displaying messages on the form had to be adjusted. We do not yet have this out-of-the-box, but if you are interested in some kind of "joint venture" to adapt activeTAPI, [let us know](mailto:msc@activeTAPI.net).
