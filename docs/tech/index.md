*activeTAPI for Microsoft Dynamics 365* is based on the **Schmidt e-Services** *Platform Services Technology*. This technology allows us to execute all business logic in the controlled context of a Plugin - and server-side. 

Clients will never 'leave' their safe Microsoft Dynamics 365 environment. 

Client will request a service, which finally executes on the server.
